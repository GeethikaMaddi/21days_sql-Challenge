### Hosted by: @DPDzero
###  **#SQLWithIDC**  


## 📋 Overview  
This repository contains my daily submissions for the **21 Days SQL Challenge**, a learning initiative by **Indian Data Club** and **DPDzero**.  
Each day features a new SQL problem designed to strengthen understanding of **database querying**, **data manipulation**, and **real-world SQL problem-solving**.

---

## 🗓️ Challenge Goal  
- Strengthen SQL fundamentals (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, etc.)  
- Apply advanced SQL concepts like subqueries, window functions, and CTEs  
- Build consistency and hands-on database querying practice over 21 days  


## 🏥 Hospital Database Schema  

Below is the sample **hospital database** used for solving challenge problems.  
It contains 4 key tables that store information about patients, hospital staff, and available services.

| **Table Name** | **Description** |
|----------------|-----------------|
| `patients` | Stores information about patients such as ID, name, age, gender, and admitted service. |
| `service_weekly` | Lists hospital services offered each week (e.g., Cardiology, Orthopedics, Neurology). |
| `staff` | Contains details about doctors, nurses, and other hospital employees. |
| `staff_schedule` | Tracks staff service assignments, shift timings, and weekly work schedules. |
